This a basic flask app (dummy) for working with github actions and azure deployment

-> to start this app on local machine use following command in the virtual environment - python -m flask --app .\main.py run


-> tried to deploy this basic application on azure webapp following the following youtube tutorial - https://youtu.be/b2oyxbSbLPA
-> workflow can also be setup using the default/sample workflow available on github actions itself for deploying python app on azure webapp

-> tried setting up workflow for this but there was issue for source control token not added/found or credentials not found
